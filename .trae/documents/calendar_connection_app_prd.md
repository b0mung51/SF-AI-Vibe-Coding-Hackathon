## 3. Core Process
**User Connection Flow:**
Users register and search for other users to connect with. They send connection requests which must be accepted before calendar integration becomes available.

**Calendar Integration Flow:**
Once connected, users link their Cal.com accounts to share availability data. The system syncs calendar information and identifies mutual free time slots.

**Meeting Scheduling Flow:**
Users view suggested meeting times, select preferred slots, and create meeting invites that are sent to both parties for confirmation.
